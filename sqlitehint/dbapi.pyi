    Open a connection to an SQLite database.

    Parameters:
        - database (`StrOrBytesPath`): The path to the database file to be opened. You can pass ":memory:" to
                                       create an SQLite database existing only in memory, and open a connection to it.

        - timeout (`float`): How many seconds the connection should wait before raising an OperationalError when a table
                             is locked. If another connection opens a transaction to modify a table, that table will be
                             locked until the transaction is committed. Default five seconds.

        - detect_types (`int`): Control whether and how data types not natively supported by SQLite are looked up to be
                                converted to Python types, using the converters registered with `register_converter()`.
                                Set it to any combination (using |, bitwise or) of PARSE_DECLTYPES and PARSE_COLNAMES
                                to enable this. Column names takes precedence over declared types if both flags are set.

        - isolation_level (`str | None`): Control legacy transaction handling behaviour. See `Connection.isolation_level`
                                          and Transaction control via the isolation_level attribute for more information.
                                          Can be "DEFERRED" (default), "EXCLUSIVE" or "IMMEDIATE"; or None to disable
                                          opening transactions implicitly. Has no effect unless `Connection.autocommit`
                                          is set to LEGACY_TRANSACTION_CONTROL (the default).
        - check_same_thread (`bool`): If True (default), ProgrammingError will be raised if the database connection is
                                      used by a thread other than the one that created it. If False, the connection may
                                      be accessed in multiple threads; write operations may need to be serialized by the
                                      user to avoid data corruption.

        - factory (`type[sqlite3.Connection]`): A custom subclass of Connection to create the connection with,
                                                if not the default Connection class.

        - cached_statements (`int`): The number of statements that sqlite3 should internally cache for this connection,
                                     to avoid parsing overhead. By default, 128 statements.

        - uri (`bool`): If set to True, database is interpreted as a URI with a file path and an optional query string.
                        The scheme part must be "file:", and the path can be relative or absolute.

        - autocommit (`bool` - New in version 3.12): Control PEP 249 transaction handling behaviour. autocommit currently
                                                     defaults to LEGACY_TRANSACTION_CONTROL. The default will change to
                                                     False in a future Python release.
        
        - context_block (`bool`): Specifies the context blocking situation. If True, the `context()` block is True on default,
                                  And vice versa.
